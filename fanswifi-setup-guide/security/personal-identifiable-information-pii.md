## Personal Identifiable Information (PII)

Personal Identifiable Information refers to any data or details that can be used to identify or locate an individual. Examples of PII include names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, social security numbers, and more. Safeguarding PII is crucial to maintaining user privacy and preventing unauthorized access.

## Hidden User Info

To protect user identities, we utilize a feature called **"hidden user info" by default.** This means that sensitive PII is concealed from unauthorized access. We employ this measure to minimize the risk of identity theft, fraud, and other malicious activities.

## Unlocking hidden PII

To unlock hidden PII, users are required to undergo an additional layer of security through One-Time Password (OTP) verification. This process ensures that only authorized individuals with the correct OTP can access sensitive PII. By implementing OTP verification, we add an extra level of protection against unauthorized access to personal information.

## Data Security
