# 6.6 Settings - Venue & Login portal - Controller Configuration

The Access Point (**AP**) Setup Guide will specify whether the current Access Point requires any adjustments to the 'Controller' settings. Often, the majority of APs do not require these changes.

Please keep note of the following:

1. **Unlisted AP Models**: If your company has installed APs that are not mentioned in the AP Setup Guide by brand and model, it will be necessary to acquire a compatible one.
2. **Listed AP Models without 'Controller' Settings**: If your Access Point corresponds to the model mentioned in the guidebook but does not indicate the need for 'Controller' settings, no additional information is required when configuring the Venue settings.
3. **Listed AP Models with 'Controller' Settings**: If the AP device specified in the guidebook does require 'Controller' settings, kindly provide the relevant information as outlined in the AP Setup Guide.
