# 3.2 Reports - WiFi Users

## WiFi Users

The ‘WiFi Users’ section provides a comprehensive overview of all connected WiFi users. It displays detailed information about each user, including their name, gender, age, date of birth, email address, total number of visits, last login method used, last access & first login timestamp, and last seen activity.

In this section, administrators have the option to delete the data logs of specific WiFi users if necessary. They can also access the same information mentioned above in the ‘Access Log’ section, allowing for a consolidated view of user details and access activities.

The circle on the left side displays an identifier or number to create a comprehensive profile of the WiFi user. When personally identifiable information (PII) is disabled, it will show the profile picture from the social media platform used to access WiFi. However, when PII is enabled, it will display the initial or first digit of the user's phone number
