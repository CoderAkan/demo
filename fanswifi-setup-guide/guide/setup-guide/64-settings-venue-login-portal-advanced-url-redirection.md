# 6.4 Settings - Venue & Login portal - Advanced (URL Redirection)

Once the WiFi user connects to the Captive Portal, they will be guided through a series of steps before gaining internet access. These steps typically include:

1. The user is prompted to follow or like the company's social media account or fan page. This engagement helps increase social media reach and lets users stay updated on the company's news, updates, and promotions.
2. After connecting to social media, the user will be presented with promotional content to scroll through on the campaign page. This step aims to enhance user engagement and provide them with valuable information or offers related to products, services, or events.
3. Once the user has completed the required actions, they will be granted access to the network.

In this scenario, after connecting to the WiFi through the Captive Portal, the company can redirect the user to a specific page of their choice instead of the default redirection to Google. This gives the company control over what content or information they want to bring to the WiFi user's attention.

**Steps to Set Up URL Redirection**

1. Access the FansWiFi Dashboard by logging into your account.
2. Navigate to the Venues & Login Portals on Settings, Click Edit, Navigate to the

Advanced section

3. Enter the URL for redirection, such as your business webpage or membership page.
4. Save your changes to apply the settings.

The desired page can be the company's official website or any other relevant destination that the company deems important for user engagement or communication. By leveraging this feature, the company can strategically guide users to specific web pages that align with their marketing objectives or provide valuable information to users.

Redirecting the user to a customized page allows the company to ensure that users are directed to content that is relevant and aligned with the company's goals. This level of control enables the company to maximize the impact of the WiFi connection and effectively communicate its desired message or offerings to the users.

For returning visitors, the Captive Portal offers the option to enable seamless login, providing a convenient and hassle-free experience. When this feature is enabled, returning visitors will not need to go through the entire login process again. Instead, they will be automatically recognized and granted access to the WiFi network, saving them time and effort.

Furthermore, the Welcome Message can be customized specifically for returning visitors, enabling you to provide a personalized greeting and engage with users who have previously connected to the WiFi network. Tailoring the Welcome Message creates a more individualized and welcoming experience for returning visitors, fostering a positive connection with your brand.
