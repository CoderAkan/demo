## What is OTP?

**One-Time Password (OTP)**is a security feature that adds an extra layer of protection to your account. It generates a unique password that is valid for a single login session or transaction, making it highly secure against unauthorized access.

## Using OTP

When you log in to the platform after enabling OTP, you will be asked for an additional verification code. Here's how to use OTP during the login process:

1. Enter your username and password on the login page as usual.
2. After submitting your credentials, you will be prompted to enter the OTP.
3. Once you have entered the correct OTP, you will be granted access to your account.

## Benefits of OTP

By implementing OTP and requiring two-factor authentication for all users, we provide enhanced security and protection for your account. Some key benefits of using OTP include:

- Increased Security: OTP adds an additional layer of protection to your account, making it significantly harder for unauthorized individuals to gain access.
- Privacy Protection: OTP ensures that only authorized personnel can log in to the platform, safeguarding your personal and sensitive information.
- Reduced Risk of Account Compromise: Even if your password is compromised, an attacker would still need the OTP to gain access, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

❗Remember to**keep your OTP confidential**and**avoid sharing it with anyone**. If you suspect any suspicious activity or encounter issues with OTP, please contact our support team immediately.

By following these guidelines and enabling OTP for your account, you can enjoy a higher level of security and peace of mind while using our platform.
