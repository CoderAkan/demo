## Enhanced Data Protection:

We utilize industry-standard security protocols to enhance data protection. These include:

2. **AES 256 Encryption**: We employ AES 256 encryption, one of the most secure encryption algorithms available. This ensures that your data is encrypted and protected from unauthorized access.
3. **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: We leverage the power of AWS to enhance the security and reliability of our platform. AWS provides a highly secure infrastructure that meets stringent security standards, allowing us to maintain a secure environment for your data.

## Data Encryption and Backups:

We take comprehensive measures to protect your data both at rest and in transit:

1. **Encryption at Rest**: Your data is encrypted when stored in our systems, providing an additional layer of security. Even if unauthorized access to the storage occurs, the encrypted data remains inaccessible without the encryption keys.
2. **Encryption in Transit**: We ensure that data transmitted over public networks is encrypted to prevent interception and unauthorized access. This safeguards your data while it is being transmitted between your device and our servers.
3. **Daily Backups**: We implement daily backups of your data to ensure its availability and protection. In the event of a system failure or data loss, these backups allow us to restore your information and minimize any potential disruptions.

By implementing these security measures, we strive to provide a secure environment for our users and their data. If you have any further questions or concerns regarding our security practices, please don't hesitate to reach out to our support team.
