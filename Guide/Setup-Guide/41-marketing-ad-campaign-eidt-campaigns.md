## Create First Ad (Campaign)

To create an advertising campaign, start by setting the name of the ad for internal reference, which will not be visible to WiFi users. Additionally, determine the preferred display priority of the campaign.

Next, curate the Audience template to precisely target your desired audience market. This step involves specifying demographic details such as age, gender, visit type as well as login method types. Moreover, generate a Content template that effectively presents and highlights the intended audience. This includes creating compelling titles, engaging descriptions, choosing appropriate images or videos, and defining action titles.

For initial campaign setup, it is necessary to create ‘Audience’ and ‘Content’ templates. These templates enable the personalization of the target audience and campaign content. If there are existing templates saved, you can conveniently choose them from the dropdown list to streamline the process.

`By following these steps, you can create an advertising campaign tailored to your specific needs, ensuring it reaches the right audience with captivating content.`
