The administration has the option to capture screenshots of the analysis. This allows you to capture a comprehensive view of the entire dashboard interface, including the various elements, data visualizations, and any relevant information displayed.

Taking screenshots can be useful, particularly of total/new/returned users, average age, the busiest day of the week, the busiest time of the day, and the chart of new/returned users for documentation purposes, sharing insights, or preserving a snapshot of the dashboard's current state for future reference.

By capturing the entire dashboard in a screenshot, the admin can ensure that all the relevant details and visualizations are captured in a single image, providing a comprehensive representation of the dashboard's content.
